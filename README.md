# livys-shiny-counter
a shiny hunt encounter tracker i wrote in python!

I've never shared a program before, and python isn't exactly the best way to do this, but I made this for my Compsci Principals final and python is all I know so far. 

You'll need python to run this, most macs and linux distros come with it installed but on windows you might need to install it yourself!

You'll also need tkinter and configparser, which you can install in your terminal with the "pip install tkinter" and "pip install configparser" commands ^_^

also i only tested this on linux so sorry if there are bugs on other operating systems! 

in terms of actually using it, just make sure the config.ini is in the same folder as the python file or else the saving system wont work!! if you want you can use auto-py-to-exe or pyinstaller to turn it into an exe, or run it in your terminal with the "python counter.py" command. Also, you can edit the config.ini in a text editor to add the stats for any ongoing runs you have. 

Hope it works well for you, be sure to report any issues you have! ^_^
